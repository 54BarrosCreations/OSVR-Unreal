## Unreal Engine Plugin for OSVR
Currently in a functional but preliminary state. Contributions and cleanups gladly accepted.

The `OSVRUnreal` folder contains a sample application using the plugin from source, for ease of development.

The plugin itself is inside `OSVRUnreal/Plugins/OSVR`.

Currently works with Unreal Engine 4.9.x.

Additional branches (soon to be merged) such as https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-Unreal/tree/ue4_8 work with Unreal Engine 4.8 and other versions.
