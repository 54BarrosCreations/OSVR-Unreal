## Unreal Engine Plugin for OSVR
Currently in a functional but preliminary state. Contributions and cleanups gladly accepted.

The `OSVRUnreal` folder contains a sample application using the plugin from source, for ease of development.

The plugin itself is inside `OSVRUnreal/Plugins/OSVR`.

Currently works with Unreal Engine 4.6.x.
